# High School Math
In this chapter I am refreshing my memories for high school. More specifically:
* Linear Equations
* Linearization
* Quadratic Equations
* Trigonometry

Furthermore, I am making first steps in Python plotting with `matplotlib`.

Finally, I am delving into Perlin Noise - as a way to exercise everything learned in this chapter.
